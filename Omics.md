In this task view, we focused on the most important CRAN packages, which have been published more than one year ago and are regularly updated. The task view is structured into main topics:

-   [Annotation](#annotation)
-   [Genomics](#genomics)
-   [Human genetic epidemiology](#human)
-   [Proteomics](#proteomics)
-   [Transcriptomics](#transcriptomics)
-   [Metabolomics](#metabolomics)
-   [Bacterial genomics, microbiome and metagenomics](#metagenomics)
-   [Integration of differents omics](#integration)
-   [Specific tasks](#tasks)
-   [Specific application fields](#applications)

Complementary information might also be found in `r view("Phylogenetics")`, `r view("StatisticalGenetics")`, `r view("MachineLearning")` `r view("Agriculture")`. Note that packages covering statistical genetics data (DNA data, haplotype estimation, population structure, genetic epidemiology), phylogenetics and phylogenomics are not covered by the Statistical Genomics task view.

If you think we have missed some important packages in this list, please e-mail the maintainers or submit an issue or pull request in the GitHub repository linked above.
