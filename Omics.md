In this task view, we focused on the most important CRAN packages, which have been published more than one year ago and are regularly updated. The task view is structured into main topics:

-   [Annotation](#annotation)
-   [Genomics](#genomics)
-   [Human genetic epidemiology](#human)
-   [Methylation](#methylation)
-   [Transcriptomics](#transcriptomics)
-   [Proteomics](#proteomics)
-   [Metabolomics](#metabolomics)
-   [Bacterial genomics, microbiome and metagenomics](#metagenomics)
-   [Integration of differents omics](#integration)
-   [Specific tasks](#tasks)
-   [Specific application fields](#applications)

Complementary information might also be found in `r view("Phylogenetics")`, `r view("StatisticalGenetics")`, `r view("MachineLearning")` `r view("Agriculture")`. Note that packages covering statistical genetics data (DNA data, haplotype estimation, population structure, genetic epidemiology), phylogenetics and phylogenomics are not covered by the Statistical Genomics task view.

If you think we have missed some important packages in this list, please e-mail the maintainers or submit an issue or pull request in the GitHub repository linked above.

[**Annotation**]{#annotation}

-   `r pkg("AnnotationBustR")` extracts subsequences into FASTA files from GenBank annotations where gene names may vary among accessions.

-   `r pkg("BED")` for Biological Entity Dictionary is an interface for the [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) database providing mapping between different identifiers of biological entities.

-   `r pkg("biomart")` provides  an interface to the 'BioMart' database and a standardized way to automate genome, proteome, 'RNA', coding sequence ('CDS'), 'GFF', and metagenome retrieval from 'NCBI RefSeq', 'NCBI Genbank', 'ENSEMBL', and 'UniProt' databases.

-   `r pkg("toprdata")` provides gene and exon information from Ensembl genome
    builds.
-   `r pkg("valr")` can be used to read and manipulate genome intervals and
    signals.
-   `r pkg("vhica")` can be used to detect horizontal transfers of transposable 
    elements from their divergence compared with regular genes.
-   `r pkg("WebGestaltR")` uses [WebGestalt](http://www.webgestalt.org/) to 
    perform Gene Set Enrichment and Network Topology analysis. `r pkg("VAM")`
    proposes a gene set testing method that is better designed than standard 
    ones to handle single-cell RNA-seq data. `r pkg("tmod")`provides functions
    for gene set enrichment analysis in transcriptomic and metabolic profiling
    data.
-   `r pkg("topologyGSA")` performs gene expression data tests using given
    pathway information on genes.

   
[**Genomics**](#genomics)

-   `r pkg("apex")` contains a collection of tools for the analysis aligned DNA sequences from multiple genes.
-   `r pkg("aroma.cn")` implements several methods for normalizing and analyzing DNA copy-number data.
-   `r pkg("babelgene")` converts between human and non-human gene orthologs/homologs and integrates orthology assertion predictions sourced from multiple databases as compiled by the HGNC Comparison of Orthology Predictions.
-   `r pkg("crispRdesignR")` designs guide sequences for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.
-   `r pkg("cumSeg")` estimates the number and location of change points in mean-shift (piecewise constant) models, such as genomic sequences.

[**Methylation**]{#methylation}

-   `r pkg("TCA")` can deconvolve bulk condition-specific DNA methylation data
    into condition and individual specific methylation levels and detect 
    associations with phenotypes.

[**Transcriptomics**]{#transcriptomics}

 
- `r pkg("conos")` can be used to identify recurrent cell clusters in collections of single-cell RNA-seq datasets and to propagate information between datasets in multi-sample or atlas-scale collections.\
- `r pkg("cubfits")` estimates mutation and selection coefficients on synonymous codon bias usage based on models of ribosome overhead cost (ROC), and estimates and predicts protein production rates.
- `r pkg("bda")` implements algorithms for binned data analysis, gene expression data analysis and measurement error models for ordinal data analysis. 
-   `r pkg("Tmisc")`is a collection of utility functions to manipulate gene
    expression data.
-   `r pkg("TailRank")`provides a tail-rank non parametric test for microarray
    datasets.
-   `r pkg("TwoPhaseInd")` estimates gene-treatment interactions in randomized
    clinical trials.
-   `r pkg("TcGSA")` and `r pkg("TGS")` implement methods for longitudinal 
    gene-expression data analysis.
-   `r pkg("treefit")` infers cell trajectories (as trees) from single-cell gene
    expression data.

[**Proteomics**]{#proteomics}


-   `r pkg("aLFQ")` implements the most commonly used absolute label-free protein abundance estimation methods for LC-MS/MS modes quantifying on either MS1-, MS2-levels or spectral counts together with validation algorithms to enable automated data analysis and error estimation.
-   `r pkg("bio3d")`contains utilities to process, organize and explore protein structure, sequence and dynamics data.

-   `r pkg("wrProteo", priority = "core")` contains a collection of functions 
    for the analysis of mass spectrometry proteomic data.
-   `r pkg("ypssc")` is designed to analyzed outputs of 
    [MaxQuant](https://www.maxquant.org)], which is a quantitative proteomics 
    tool for large mass-spectrometric datasets.


[**Bacterial genomics, microbiome and metagenomics**]{#metagenomics}

-   `r pkg("BarcodingR")` performs species identification using DNA barcodes.\
-   `r pkg("BacArena")` can be used for simulation of organisms living in     communities. Each organism is represented individually and genome scale metabolic models determine the uptake and release of compounds.

[**Integration**]{#integration}

    
- `r pkg("CovCombR")` can be used to combine heterogeneous data sets through a covariance based method.    

-   `r pkg("wrMisc")` contains a collection of tools to manipulate omics data
    and to perform various simple statistical analyses (including normalization
    and some statistical tests).

[**Specific tasks**]{#tasks}

-   *Multiple testing*:

-   *High dimensional data - regularization*: `r pkg("whitening")` implements 
    whitening methods and CCA for high-dimensional omics data.

-   *Networks*:

-   *Visualization*: 
    `r pkg("cRegulome")` builds a 'SQLite' database and enables the visualization of Regulome-Gene    Expression Correlations in Cancer.\
    
`r pkg("tinyarray")` is dedicated to the visualization of
    GEO and TCGA expression data.\ 
    `r pkg("valr")` can be used to visualize genome-scale data. 
    `r pkg("VALERIE")` enables visualization of alternative splicing event from
    single-cell data.\

    to visualize biomarker differential analysis results for 3-class problems.\ 
    `r pkg("wilson")` is a web-based tool dedicated to the visualization of 
    multi-omics data in an interactive way. \ 

[**Specific application fields**]{#applications}

-   *Cancer*: `r pkg("tidyestimate")` infers tumor purity from expression data.

-   *Plant breeding*:
